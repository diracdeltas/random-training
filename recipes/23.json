  "instructions": "Sear the steaks in a skillet on medium high (about 2 to 3 minutes per side), seasoning each side with a pinch of salt and pepper as the other side cooks. Remove the steaks from the skillet, and reduce the heat to medium.\nPut the olive oil, thyme, and garlic in the skillet, stirring frequently and scraping with a spoon to release the brown bits left behind by the meat (about 30 seconds).\nAdd the stock and mushrooms, stirring often until the mushrooms soften (about 3 minutes).\nUse red wine instead of chicken stock for a more sophisticated flavor.",
