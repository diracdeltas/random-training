  "instructions": "In a large skillet heat olive oil over medium heat. Add spinach, prosciutto, basil, artichoke hearts, shallots, and garlic. Cook and stir until spinach is wilted.\nIn a bowl whisk together eggs, dash salt, and dash ground black pepper. Pour over vegetables in skillet. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until mixture begins to set on bottom and around edge. With spatula or large spoon, lift and fold partially cooked egg mixture so uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking 2 to 3 minutes or until egg mixture is cooked through and still glossy and moist. Remove from heat. Wrap tortillas in white paper towels; heat in microwave oven on 100 percent power (high) for 30 to 60 seconds or just until warmed. Spread each tortilla with pesto to within 1 inch of edge. Sprinkle cheese over pesto. Evenly divide egg mixture among tortillas; roll up, tucking in ends. Serve with warm Classico(R) Tomato and Basil pasta sauce.",
